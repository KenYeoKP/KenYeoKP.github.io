### Uncovering trends in HDB resale market

#### *A Visualisation Project*

Singaporeâ€™s public housing, also known as HDB flats, has gained a global reputation as one of the most successful projects in the world. Yet, ironically (or perhaps not so much), these flats are notorious for their small size, high prices, and 99-year leaseholds. Owning a house is generally considered one of life's greatest financial commitments, but under these antagonistic conditions in Singapore, buying or selling an HDB flat can either skyrocket or severely hinder one's financial growth.

As the clock ticks down towards the end of these leases, how does one determine the appropriate price of a flat based on its completion date or remaining lease? Let me share some insights using data obtained from data.gov.sg between January 2021 and February 2024.
